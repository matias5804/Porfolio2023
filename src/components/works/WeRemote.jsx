            The WeRemote challenge was a project that I had to work on for the
            selection process of a position as a Front-End Developer. The site
            was created and developed in React js, it also has styles and
            animations with CSS (sass and bem). It also included a hero, news
            grid, testimonial boxes, FAQs in accordion mode, contact form, and
            modal window..
